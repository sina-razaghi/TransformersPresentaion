A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV).

I had a presentation about this model and prepared a PowerPoint with a few lines of code.

I hope it is useful for you
